HTML Survival guide

# Chapter 1 - Start here
Every page starts with opening and closing `html` tags and everything else on the page goes between those tags.
html pages have 2 main area :
- one area contains data that in not seen on the page but is considered to be meta-data about the page : it is the `head` area
- The next area is the part the everybody sees in the browser. It's the `body` element

`h1` is the biggest heading, with `h6`being the smallest

`<html lang="en">` : language attribute
`<meta charset="UTF-8">` : meta tag
